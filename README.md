# NFT Supported Web3 Social Media App

# Summary

Nowadays, billions of people uses social media apps and these apps earns billions of dollars from the users. Howewer, that social media apss used  ##Howewer,  these social media apps everyone frequently uses## (like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc.) are centralised apps. Centralised apps keeps all the data (like users’ personal data, shared contents in the platform, comments, replies etc.) in a central database. ##in a center (in a database)## But the system that we developed purposes to be an IPFS-based uncentralised social media platform alternative. IPFS-based uncentralised apps does not stores all the data in a central database unlike centralised apps. ##With the IPFS-based uncentralised apps, the data of platform doesn’t held in a central database unlike centralised apps.??????## This data held in a network of many computers are uncentralised; so can not be collected by companies,  can not fall into (?) the hands of malicious people and continues to stored forever. These features brought by IPFS makes our project an alternative for classic social media apps. Our Project also uses etherium blockchain, so the users can turn their sharings on IPFS into NFT’s by uploading them to blockchain. This gives the potential for buying important moments on internet, owning the contents that shared by loved ones, providing extra income to content creators and gives power to the project for being an alternative for classic social media apps. Our project also has the potential to be a social NFT platform.

# Decentralised Sharings And NFT:

Thanks to the IPFS-based decentralised social media application we have developed,users can easily mint their contents,which are kept decentralised in IPFS as NFT.In addition to this, NFT artists can easily share their works on the platform, Mint and put them on sale if they want. The NFT artists' works are offered for sale through the system we designed, allowing users to comment, like, etc. on the artist's posts. It enables them to interact and make NFT works more social, making it an indication that the artist's work is preferred. The fact that the shares can interact with both content producers and users makes the project interesting and usable for both parties. Our project is interesting for both creators and users because both creators and users can interact with the content.

# Stories And Contents On Other Platforms:

Although users can share exactly the same sharings in social media applications such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Tiktok on our platform, but some conveniences can be provided by using oAuth 2.0 and various APIs instead of dealing with sharing same things one by one, in order to make sharing same things easier for the accounts with large numbers of followers . For example, in a marketplace named Valuables by Cent, you can mint your Tweets as NFT with one click. In this way, users get rid of uploading their tweets one by one and people with no access to your account, can not mint your sharings because you have to link your Twitter account for minting Tweets. A similar path can be followed in our project. By asking users to link their accounts on other platforms, it can be facilitated and security can be increased to prevent theft of the sharings of the owners of these accounts. At the same time, when accounts of apps like Instagram and Snapchat are linked; not only sharings, also stories can be minted as NFT. Thus, content creators can make income from story NFT's by making their stories persistent in blockchain. Many platforms such as Twitch, Youtube, OnlyFans allow the sharing of special content only for subscribed users in order to support content creators to make income from their content. 

# Subscription System And Subscription NFTs:

Many platforms such as Twitch,Youtube and Onlyfans supports just-for-subscribers contents for providing  extra income for content creators.Also in our project, we will follow a similar path by creating a NFT based subscription system.In this way, users can create just-for-subscribers contents with their public contents. Just-for-subscription contents will be stored on IPFS(decentralised) and could be” Minted” as NFTs and sold like public contents. The project we have developed is interesting for content creators,as the subscription system and the ability to “Mint” just-for-subscribers for contents have the potential to provide increase in the incomes of content creators.
